# Credit_Risk_Classification Report

## overview of the analysis: 

In this Challenge, I used various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.



## The results: 

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * f1-score: 1.00
  * Precision: 1.00
  * Recall scores: 1.00



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * f1-score: 0.88
  * Precision: 0.87
  * Recall scores: 0.89


## Summary: 

I recommand the Logistic Regression Model for use by the company. The predication of 0 (healthy loan) is highly accurate with tje score of 1.00 of all precision,recall, and f1-score. The prediction of 1 (high-risk loan) is less accurate but still have 0.87 to 0.89 of the precision,recall, and f1-score. Total accuracy if 0.99 wich is very high.
